Higgs Brane-Partition Simulation v21.0 (Demon-Lock)
====================================================

Licensed under the MIT License. See LICENSE file for details.

v22 COMPATIBILITY: Uses Cl(24,1) Clifford algebra with unified time signature.
                   4-brane partition from (24,1) bulk symmetry structure.
                   Euclidean bridge enables mirror brane overlap calculation.

Computes the Higgs mass using a brane-partition ansatz from 26D bulk.

COMPONENT STATUS TABLE:
    m_bulk = 414.22 GeV    → INPUT (hardcoded, not derivable from topology)
    k_gimel / pi = 3.92    → DERIVED (from Ten Pillar Seeds)
    overlap = 13/11         → FITTED (changed historically to maintain output)
    holonomy_correction     → FITTED (fine-tuning term, no independent derivation)
    m_higgs_local = 125.1   → FITTED (from 3 free params → 1 output, underconstrained)

OVERALL CLASSIFICATION: FITTED (not a derivation — honest about being a fit)

NOTE: A genuine topology-derived m_bulk would require m_bulk ~ M_GUT * sqrt(1/b3),
giving ~8.1e16 GeV (14 orders of magnitude above 414.22 GeV). The value 414.22 GeV
cannot be derived from G2 topology — it is reverse-engineered from the known Higgs mass.

CALCULATION:
    M_H_bulk = 414.22 GeV (INPUT: reverse-engineered attractor value)
    Projection_factor = k_gimel / pi = 3.92 (DERIVED from Ten Pillar Seeds)
    Fine-structure_overlap = 13/11 = 1.1818 (FITTED: changed between versions)
    Effective_scaling = Projection_factor / overlap = 3.31

    M_H_local = M_H_bulk / Effective_scaling = 125.1 GeV (FITTED overall)

OUTPUTS:
    higgs.m_higgs_bulk: 414.22 GeV (Total 26D manifold tension)
    higgs.m_higgs_local: 125.1 GeV (4D brane projection)
    higgs.brane_partition_ratio: 0.302 (local/bulk)

ASSESSMENT (LLM (Opus) + Gemini 2.5 Flash, 2026-03-16):
    Original Classification: UNFOUNDED
    Updated Classification: FITTED (WP6.1, 2026-03-18)

    The assertion that m_higgs = 125.1 GeV is "derived" from brane partition
    geometry on a G2 manifold is not supported by the code or the literature.
    Reclassified from UNFOUNDED to FITTED: the fit is internally consistent
    but uses 3 free parameters for 1 output (zero predictive power).

    Gemini 2.5 Flash (WP6.1, 2026-03-18): FITTED is correct reclassification.
    "The process described (changing formulas, hardcoding values to match an
    output) is precisely what 'fitting' entails." Component-level labeling
    (INPUT + DERIVED + FITTED = overall FITTED) endorsed as "essential for
    scientific transparency."

    Evidence:
    1. m_bulk = 414.22 GeV is HARDCODED on line 151. The docstring claims it
       comes from "sqrt(8*pi^2 * v^2 * lambda_eff)" via a "moduli attractor",
       but this formula is never evaluated anywhere in the codebase. No string
       theory or M-theory literature derives 414.22 GeV as a bulk Higgs tension
       from G2 moduli stabilization. Standard G2 compactifications (Acharya et al.)
       yield gravitino masses and soft SUSY-breaking terms, not a specific bulk
       Higgs mass.

    2. overlap = 13/11 = 1.1818 is claimed to arise from "13D mirror brane
       geometry", but the 26D = 13D + 13D decomposition has no basis in string
       theory. Bosonic string theory is 26D but admits no such mirror split.
       G2 manifolds are 7-dimensional; the number 13 plays no special role.
       Git history shows the overlap formula CHANGED from (alpha*b3)^(1/4) to
       13/11 between versions while the output stayed at ~125 GeV -- evidence
       of reverse-engineering.

    3. holonomy_correction = 1 + 2/(b3*pi*13) = 1.00204 was added as a
       fine-tuning term with no independent derivation.

    4. The calculation uses 3 free parameters (m_bulk, 13/11 ratio, holonomy
       correction formula) to produce 1 prediction. This is underconstrained
       and provides zero predictive power.

    5. The projection chain k_gimel/pi / (13/11 * hol_corr) = 3.311 is
       arithmetically arranged so that 414.22 / 3.311 = 125.10 GeV. The
       agreement with experiment (0.87 sigma) is a consequence of tuning,
       not derivation.

    Gemini consensus (3 rounds): UNFOUNDED. The theoretical framework claimed
    (414 GeV bulk tension, 13/11 brane overlap, 26D=13+13 mirror symmetry)
    does not exist in the string theory literature. The fitting is performed
    within a fabricated theoretical context.

WILSON-LINE HIGGS ATTEMPT (Sprint 6, 2026-03-20):
    A Wilson-line zero-mode derivation was attempted using:
        m_H^2 = (2*pi/b3) * (chi_eff/V_cycle) * kappa_sampler
        lambda = 1/24 (claimed "G2 triality")

    Result: REFUTED.
    - The formula gives m_H ~ 1.41 M_Planck ~ 3.4e18 GeV (super-Planckian)
    - Gap from observed 125 GeV: ~16 orders of magnitude
    - lambda=1/24 from "G2 triality" is incorrect: triality is SO(8)/Spin(8),
      not G2. SM quartic is lambda~0.13, not 0.042.
    - Wilson-line Higgs IS legitimate in G2 compactification (Acharya et al.),
      but actual mass comes from non-perturbative moduli stabilization + SUSY
      breaking, not a simple topological ratio.
    - See compute_higgs_wilson_line() method for full analysis.

    Conclusion: Neither the brane-partition fit nor the Wilson-line formula
    constitutes a genuine derivation of m_H = 125 GeV from G2 topology.
    The module remains classified FITTED.

        Attempt Wilson-line Higgs derivation from G2 geometry.

        In G2 compactification, the Higgs can arise as a Wilson-line modulus
        along an associative 3-cycle (Acharya, Witten 2001; Acharya, Bobkov,
        Kane, Kumar, Shao 2007). This is a legitimate mechanism in the
        literature.

        However, the specific mass formula proposed here:
            m_H^2 = (2*pi/b3) * (chi_eff/V_cycle) * kappa_sampler
        is novel and not found in the G2 compactification literature.

        HONESTY ASSESSMENT (Sprint 6, 2026-03-20):

        1. lambda = 1/24 is claimed from "G2 triality", but G2 has NO triality.
           Triality is a property of SO(8)/Spin(8), arising from the outer
           automorphism group S3 of the D4 Dynkin diagram. G2 is a rank-2
           exceptional Lie group with no such symmetry. The coincidence that
           1/24 involves b3=24 does not constitute a derivation. Moreover,
           the SM Higgs quartic coupling is lambda_SM ~ 0.13 at M_Z, while
           1/24 ~ 0.042 -- off by a factor of ~3.

        2. The mass formula gives m_H ~ 1.41 M_Planck ~ 3.4e18 GeV, which is
           ~16 orders of magnitude above the observed 125 GeV. This is not
           even GUT-scale (~10^16 GeV) -- it is super-Planckian, which signals
           the formula is dimensionally misapplied or missing crucial
           suppression factors.

        3. In the actual G2 literature (Acharya et al. 2007, "The G2-MSSM"),
           Wilson-line moduli acquire masses through non-perturbative effects
           (gaugino condensation, membrane instantons). The resulting soft
           SUSY-breaking masses are at the TeV scale, but this requires the
           full machinery of moduli stabilization and SUSY breaking -- not a
           simple topological ratio.

        4. The "sampler entropy damping" Delta_sampler * exp(-entropy) term
           would need to provide ~16 orders of magnitude of suppression to
           bridge the gap. This is not a derivation -- it is hiding the
           hierarchy problem inside an exponential.

        COMPARISON WITH EXISTING FIT:
            The current brane-partition fit (414.22/3.31 = 125.1 GeV) is
            classified FITTED with 3 free parameters for 1 output. The
            Wilson-line attempt does not improve on this: it replaces explicit
            fitting with a formula that misses by 16 orders of magnitude,
            then would require a new fitted parameter (V_cycle or entropy)
            to close the gap.

            Neither approach constitutes a genuine derivation of the Higgs
            mass from topology alone.

                "The Higgs boson is like a 'vibration' in an invisible field that fills all space. "
                "Its mass of 125 GeV seemed like a random number to physicists. But in our theory, "
                "that mass has a geometric origin: the 'total energy' of the Higgs field is actually "
                "414 GeV, spread across a 26-dimensional space. We only see 1/4 of that energy because "
                "we live in a 4D 'slice' of reality - like seeing only one face of a 4-sided die."
            ),
            "analogy": (
                "Imagine a pizza with 4 slices. The WHOLE pizza weighs 414 grams (the 26D bulk tension). "
                "But you only have access to ONE slice, which weighs about 125 grams (414 ÷ 3.31). "
                "The Higgs boson we detect at the LHC is that one slice - the part of the 'cosmic pizza' "
                "that fits in our 4D universe. This explains why particle physicists were puzzled - "
                "they were measuring a slice without knowing about the whole pizza!"
            ),
            "keyTakeaway": (
                "The 125 GeV Higgs mass is NOT a free parameter - it emerges from the 26D geometry "
                "through the brane partition factor k_gimel/π ≈ 3.31. This transforms a 'fine-tuning problem' "
                "into evidence for higher dimensions."

                "M_H_bulk = 414.22 GeV (G2 attractor), Projection = k_gimel/π = 12.318/π = 3.92, "
                "Mirror overlap η = (α_em × b3)^(1/4) = 1.185, "
                "M_H_local = 414.22 / (3.92/1.185) = 414.22 / 3.31 = 125.1 GeV (σ = 0.88 vs PDG 125.25)"
