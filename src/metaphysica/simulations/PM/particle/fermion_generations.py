Fermion Generations v16.0 - Three Generations from G2 Topology
================================================================

Licensed under the MIT License. See LICENSE file for details.

Derives the number of fermion generations and Yukawa hierarchy from G2 manifold
topology via the Pneuma Mechanism.

MECHANISM:
1. Generation count from flux quantization and spinor saturation:
   n_gen = N_flux / spinor_DOF = (chi_eff / 6) / 8 = 144 / 48 = 3

2. Yukawa hierarchy from geometric wave-function overlaps:
   Y_f = A_f * epsilon^Q_f
   where epsilon = exp(-lambda_curvature) and Q_f is topological distance

3. Pneuma chiral filter from axial torsion coupling:
   D_eff = gamma^mu (d_mu + igA_mu + gamma^5 T_mu)

KEY RESULTS:
- Exactly 3 generations (parameter-free)
- Yukawa texture from FN mechanism (epsilon ~ 0.223)
- Chiral filter strength: 7/8 from spinor stabilization

DERIVATION CHAIN:
topology.mephorash_chi = 144 (TCS G2 manifold #187)
  -> N_flux = chi_eff / 6 = 24
  -> n_gen = N_flux / 8 = 3
  -> epsilon = exp(-1.5) ~ 0.223
  -> Y_f = A_f * epsilon^Q_f

ASSERTION ASSESSMENT (2026-03-16, LLM (Opus) + Gemini 2.5 Flash debate):
================================================================================
Assertion: "3 fermion generations from n_gen = b3/(2*h11) = 24/8 = 3,
           derived from G2 topology."

Verdict: NUMEROLOGY

Evidence and reasoning:

1. FORMULA IS NOT STANDARD. The formula n_gen = b3/(2*h11) does not appear in
   the standard G2 compactification literature (Acharya-Witten 2001, Joyce 2000,
   Acharya et al. 2012). In standard M-theory on G2 manifolds, chiral fermion
   generations arise from ADE-type singularities along 3-manifolds inside the G2
   space, not from dividing Betti numbers by spinor dimensions.

2. INCONSISTENT DERIVATION CHAIN. The assertion states n_gen = b3/(2*h11) = 24/8
   but the code actually computes n_gen = (chi_eff/6) / spinor_DOF = 144/48 = 3.
   Since chi_eff = 6*b3 by framework definition, chi_eff/6 merely recovers b3,
   making the "flux quantization" step circular. The variable h11=4 from the
   assertion does not appear in the code at all.

3. SPINOR_DOF=8 MISAPPLIED. The 8 real spinor components of Spin(7) relate to
   N=1 SUSY preservation (G2 holonomy preserves 1 of 8 spinors), not to how many
   flux quanta each fermion generation requires. There is no established physical
   mechanism connecting dim(Spin(7) spinor) to generation counting.

4. chi_eff IS FRAMEWORK-DEFINED, NOT STANDARD. Odd-dimensional manifolds have
   Euler characteristic zero. The "effective Euler characteristic" chi_eff=144 is
   a quantity defined within this framework (as 6*b3 = B3^2/4), not a standard
   topological invariant of G2 manifolds.

5. EXTENSIVE HIDDEN FITTING. The Yukawa sector contains 18 effectively fitted
   parameters (9 geometric_coeffs + 9 fn_charges) presented as "derived from
   cycle graph distances" but actually tuned to match observed fermion masses.
   lambda_curvature=1.5 is hardcoded with post-hoc justification.

6. GEMINI CONSENSUS. Gemini 2.5 Flash independently classified this as
   NUMEROLOGY across all three debate rounds, noting: "the formula is engineered
   to give 3 by choosing divisors" and "the divisor 8 is chosen without a
   rigorous physical or mathematical derivation relevant to fermion generations."

Classification: NUMEROLOGY - The arithmetic 24/8=3 is correct, and the
ingredients (b3, Spin(7) dimension) are real mathematical objects from G2
geometry. However, the specific combination b3/spinor_DOF has no derivation
from established physics. The formula appears reverse-engineered to yield the
known answer of 3 generations by selecting an appropriate divisor for b3=24.
