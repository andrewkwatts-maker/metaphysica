Proton Decay Simulation v17.2
===============================

Licensed under the MIT License. See LICENSE file for details.

Computes proton lifetime from TCS G2 cycle separation geometry using the
SimulationBase framework.

Key Physics:
- Geometric suppression factor S = exp(2*pi*d/R) from TCS neck topology
- Cycle separation d/R ~ 0.12 obtained from K=4 matching fibres
- Proton lifetime tau_p ~ 3.9 x 10^34 years (2.3x above Super-K bound)
- Branching ratio BR(p -> e+pi0) = 0.25 from geometric orientation sum

Physical Picture:
- In TCS G2 manifolds, matter fields localize on associative 3-cycles (supporting
  chiral zero modes) and Higgs fields on coassociative 4-cycles in opposite blocks
- The TCS neck region (S^1 x K3) acts as a topological barrier between sectors
- Separation distance determined by K3 fibre matching number K=4
- Dimension-6 proton decay operators (qqql via X,Y boson exchange) generate
  baryon-number-violating vertices with Wilson coefficient C_6 ~ alpha_GUT/M_GUT^2
- Wavefunction overlap across neck suppresses C_6 by exp(-pi*d/R), enhancing lifetime
- Selection rule: integral(psi_matter * psi_Higgs) ~ exp(-2*pi*d/R)

Independent Assessment (LLM (Opus) vs Gemini 2.5 Flash, 2026-03-16):
=========================================================================
VERDICT: PHENOMENOLOGICAL -- standard SU(5) GUT with geometric window dressing.

C_PREFACTOR = 3.82e33 years:
  - Classification: CALIBRATED/FITTED, not DERIVED.
  - The code itself labels this "calibrated to SU(5)" (line 73).
  - It absorbs hadronic matrix elements, phase space factors, and RG running
    -- all standard SU(5) inputs, none derived from G2 topology.
  - This is the dominant factor in the lifetime prediction and is NOT
    traceable to the Ten Pillar Seeds or any topological invariant.

BR = (12/24)^2 = 0.25:
  - Classification: AD HOC assertion, not a legitimate geometric derivation.
  - No established mapping exists in the literature from "orientations of
    associative 3-cycles" to proton decay branching ratios.
  - Standard GUT branching ratios depend on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients,
    CKM mixing, and representation content -- not cycle counting.
  - The squaring operation (12/24)^2 lacks physical justification: it is
    unclear whether the ratio represents an amplitude or a probability.
  - Hardcoded from the first commit; never derived or justified in code.

S = exp(1/K) ~ 1.284 (K=4):
  - Classification: PLAUSIBLE but ad hoc in its specific form.
  - The general idea of wavefunction overlap suppression across a TCS neck
    has qualitative support from Acharya et al. (2008), who studied proton
    decay in M-theory on G2 manifolds.
  - However, the specific formula d/R = 1/(2*pi*K) and the choice K=4
    ("TCS G2 #187") are not from the literature and appear model-specific.
  - This is the ONLY genuinely PM-specific contribution, providing a modest
    28% lifetime enhancement -- far less significant than the choice of
    M_GUT and alpha_GUT values.

Formula structure:
  - tau_p = C * (M_GUT/10^16)^4 * (0.03/alpha_GUT)^2 * S
  - This is entirely standard SU(5) GUT, with S appended as a multiplier.
  - The prediction's value (~4.9e34 years) is dominated by the choice of
    M_GUT = 2.118e16 GeV and alpha_GUT^{-1} = 23.54, not by topology.

Consensus (both models agree):
  - C_PREFACTOR is a fitted constant, not derivable from PM topology.
  - The simulation should be classified as PHENOMENOLOGICAL, not DERIVED.
  - The elaborate TCS narrative added in git history polishes the
    presentation but does not change the underlying calculation, which
    remains standard SU(5) with a small geometric correction factor.

            Dictionary with computed values and honest assessment.

        HONEST ASSESSMENT (Sprint 5, 2026-03-20):
        ==========================================
        VERDICT: BOTH APPROACHES FAIL as meaningful predictions.

        Approach (1) -- Moduli M_GUT = 3.96e17 GeV:
          The moduli-derived M_GUT is ~19x larger than M_GUT_geometric = 2.1e16 GeV.
          Since tau ~ M_GUT^4, this gives (3.96e17/2.1e16)^4 ~ 1.3e5 enhancement.
          Result: tau ~ 6.2e40 years -- six orders of magnitude above any foreseeable
          experimental reach. This is not a prediction; it is unfalsifiable.

          Root cause: T_min = 37.85 from racetrack stabilization was tuned for
          alpha_GUT and gauge coupling unification, not for proton decay. Using it
          naively in the proton lifetime formula produces an absurdly large result
          because the C_PREFACTOR was calibrated for M_GUT ~ 2e16 GeV.

        Approach (2) -- Entropy correction exp(S_eq):
          S_eq = 9.35e-05 from SamplerEntropyDynamics.compute_equilibrium_entropy().
          exp(9.35e-05) = 1.0000935 -- a correction of 0.009%, completely negligible.

          The user's proposal suggested exp(0.0825 * t_thermal), but "t_thermal"
          has no defined integration range. If t_thermal ~ O(1), exp(0.0825) = 1.086,
          still negligible. If t_thermal is cosmological, the result diverges.

          The entropy rate 0.0825 is dS/dt at a single instant, not an integrated
          quantity. There is no physical mechanism connecting sampler entropy to
          proton decay operator coefficients. The proposal amounts to multiplying
          by an arbitrary exponential with no theoretical basis.

        Conclusion: Neither approach produces a meaningful improvement over the
        existing phenomenological calculation. The proton decay sector remains
        PHENOMENOLOGICAL, dominated by the fitted C_PREFACTOR and the choice of
        M_GUT scale. No entropy-based correction changes this assessment.
