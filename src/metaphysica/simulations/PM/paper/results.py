PRINCIPIA METAPHYSICA v24.2 - Section 3: Cosmological Results and Alignment
=============================================================================

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18079602

v2.1.0 HONEST SCORECARD: 5 real closures + 1 geometric seed b3 → 121:1 compression
(replaces the earlier v25.0+v26.0 thirteen-closure narrative; four items
are cross-consistent confirmations, three are worse-than-prior derivations, and
one is a documented open tension on soft-SUSY gravitino mass).

This simulation generates the content for Section 3 of the paper:
  3.1 The Hubble Tension: A 1.4σ Residual
  3.2 Dark Energy Dynamics: The w₀ = -23/24 Geometric Inevitability
  3.3 Vacuum Stability: The 10⁻⁵⁰ Floor from Brane-Tension Cancellation
  3.4 Predictions Summary Table
