Asymptotic Safety UV Fixed Point — Pure G₂ Topology
=====================================================

Licensed under the MIT License. See LICENSE file for details.

Derives the asymptotic safety UV fixed point from G₂ manifold topology:

    α*⁻¹ = b₃ = dim(H³(X, ℝ)) = 24

and the dimension-6 operator enhancement from the Hitchin functional:

    λ₆_eff = exp(−χ_eff / b₃) = exp(−144/24) = exp(−6) ≈ 0.00248

Physical Picture:
    In a G₂ compactification, the Hitchin functional V_H[φ] = ∫_X φ ∧ *φ
    governs the moduli space of torsion-free G₂ structures. The harmonic
    3-forms spanning H³(X, ℝ) parameterise flat directions in this moduli
    space. At the UV fixed point where the internal geometry is frozen,
    the number of independent harmonic 3-forms sets the fixed-point coupling:

        α*⁻¹ = dim(H³(X, ℝ)) = b₃(X)

    The dimension-6 proton decay operator receives an exponential suppression
    from the ratio χ_eff / b₃, which counts the effective number of topological
    cycles per Betti direction. This ratio is an integer (144/24 = 6), giving
    a parameter-free suppression factor exp(−6) ≈ 0.00248.

Honest Assessment (2026-03-21):
===============================
CLASSIFICATION: MOTIVATED_IDENTIFICATION

α*⁻¹ = b₃ = 24:
    This is an IDENTIFICATION, not a theorem. The asymptotic safety literature
    (Reuter 1998, Niedermaier-Reuter 2006) computes fixed points from truncated
    functional RG equations; results depend on matter content, not internal
    topology. No published result connects AS fixed points to Betti numbers.

    What IS topological: b₃ = 24 is a Pillar Seed. The moduli space dimension
    genuinely equals b₃. The identification is motivated by the structural role
    of H³(X) in the gauge sector.

    What is NOT derived: the mapping from "number of flat moduli directions"
    to "inverse fixed-point coupling" requires kinetic-term normalization
    assumptions that are not automatic from the Hitchin functional alone.

exp(−χ_eff / b₃) = exp(−6):
    TOPOLOGICAL_ARITHMETIC. Both χ_eff = 144 and b₃ = 24 are Pillar Seeds.
    The ratio is an integer. The exponential form is assumed by analogy with
    instanton suppression, but the argument is purely topological.

ω = 0.15 mixing weight:
    FITTED. No derivation. Controls how strongly the AS correction mixes into
    the RG-evolved gauge couplings.
