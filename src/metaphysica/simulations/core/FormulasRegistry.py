FormulasRegistry.py - Single Source of Truth (SSoT)
====================================================
Centralizes all topological derivations for Principia Metaphysica v24.2-27D.

v24.2 FRAMEWORK (Publication Release):
- Structure: M^{27}(24,1,2) = T^1 ×_fiber (⊕_{i=1}^{12} B_i^{2,0}) ⊕ S^{2,0}
  - 24D physics: 12 bridge pairs × 2 dims = 24D (G₂ core, create dual 13D shadows)
  - 1D time: Shared T¹ fiber (unified timelike dimension)
  - 2D sampler data fields: S^{2,0} (global averaging sector, architecturally separate)
  - Total: 24 + 1 + 2 = 27D with signature (26,1)
  - Notation: 27D(24,1,2) where (physics, time, sampler data fields)
- OR: Distributed ⊗_{i=1}^{12} R_⊥_i (objective reduction across bridge pairs)
- Spinor: Cl(24,1) on 24D CORE yields 4096 components
- Dark Energy: Breathing mode from bridge size modulus (w0 = -23/24)

PEER REVIEW STATUS: Reviewed (2026-01-11)
- Documentation style approved
- Error propagation methodology approved
- Anthropic selection reframed as consistency requirements

This module acts as the "Universal Translator" between the Ten Pillar Seeds
and all derived physical constants. Every formula in the Principia flows
FROM this registry TO the simulation/certificates.

Architecture:
    Level 0: Ten Pillar Seeds (hardcoded here - the ONLY inputs)
    Level 1: Registry Logic (mathematical derivations)
    Level 2: Manifest (named_constants.json - generated OUTPUT)
    Level 3: Execution (Simulation & Validation consume the manifest)

SOLID Principles:
    S - Single Responsibility: Only manages formula derivations
    O - Open/Closed: Extend by adding methods, not modifying seeds
    L - Liskov Substitution: All derived values are interchangeable
    I - Interface Segregation: Separate getters for each domain
    D - Dependency Inversion: Simulation depends on this abstraction

    Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for Principia Metaphysica v23.0-12PAIR.

    Centralizes all topological derivations to ensure sterility across:
    1. Simulation Physics
    2. Registry Documentation
    3. Audit Certificates

    The Ten Pillars are defined here as the ONLY hardcoded values.
    Everything else is DERIVED through topological formulas.

    MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK:
    ----------------------
    The derivation chain follows a four-level hierarchy:

    Level 0 (Seeds): Ten Pillar constants from G2 and octonionic/24D topology
    Level 1 (Topology): chi_eff, k_gimel, n_gen derived from seeds
    Level 2 (Physics): alpha_em, G_N, G_F derived from topology
    Level 3 (Predictions): H0, w0, masses derived from physics

    RIGOR WARNING (per peer review 2026-01-11):
    -------------------------------------------------
    Many constants in this registry are SPECULATIVE NUMEROLOGY used for
    phenomenological fitting, NOT rigorous mathematical derivations.
    See the RIGOR DISCLAIMER section below for details.

    SELECTION PRINCIPLE (not anthropic):
    -----------------------------------
    chi_eff = 72 is the effective chiral index determined by:
    1. n_gen = |chi|/24 (standard M-theory index theorem)
    2. |chi| = 72 yields exactly 3 fermion generations: 72/24 = 3
    3. Singular TCS G2 models CAN exhibit non-zero effective Euler
       characteristic due to singularities (Acharya-Witten 2001)

    # CHI_EFF USAGE GUIDE (v23.0-12PAIR)
    # ===========================================================================
    #
    # THEORETICAL BASIS: 12x(2,0) PAIRED BRIDGE SYSTEM
    # ------------------------------------------------
    # The v23 framework has TWO 13D shadow sectors connected by Euclidean bridges.
    # Each shadow independently compactifies on G2 with effective Euler characteristic:
    #
    #   chi_eff_shadow = b3^2/8 = 576/8 = 72
    #
    # From Hodge numbers (TCS #187): chi_eff = h^{1,1} - h^{2,1} + h^{3,1} = 4-0+68 = 72
    #
    # CROSS-SHADOW TOTAL:
    # When physics involves BOTH shadows (via bridge coupling):
    #   chi_eff_total = chi_eff_normal + chi_eff_mirror = 72 + 72 = 144
    #
    # KEY PRINCIPLE: Does the physics involve one shadow or both?
    # - Quarks (CKM): Confined by QCD to single shadow -> chi_eff = 72
    # - Neutrinos (PMNS): Neutral, propagate across bridge -> chi_eff_total = 144
    #
    # Reference: docs/appendices/appendix_chi_eff_architecture.md
    # ===========================================================================
    #
    # chi_eff = chi_eff_sector = 72 (per shadow)
    #   GEOMETRIC: chi_eff_shadow = b3^2/8 = 576/8 = 72
    #   USE FOR:
    #   - n_gen = chi_eff/24 = 3 (fermion generations per sector)
    #   - gate_transition calculations (fine structure refinement)
    #   - Single-shadow physics processes (quark Yukawa, CKM)
    #   - Baryon asymmetry (b3/chi_eff ratio) - baryogenesis at single 4-brane
    #   - Torsional leakage (b3/chi_eff in epsilon_T formula)
    #   PHYSICS: Quarks carry color charge, confined within single shadow
    #
    # chi_eff_total = 144 (both shadows combined)
    #   GEOMETRIC: chi_eff_total = 72 + 72 = b3^2/4 = 576/4 = 144
    #   USE FOR:
    #   - reid_invariant = 1/chi_eff_total = 1/144
    #   - chi_parity_product = watts_constant / reid_invariant = 144
    #   - Cross-shadow processes (PMNS neutrino mixing)
    #   - N_flux = chi_eff_total/6 = 24 = b3 (flux quantization)
    #   - n_gen = chi_eff_total/48 = 3 (alternative generation formula)
    #   PHYSICS: Neutrinos are electrically neutral, propagate through bridge
    #
    # pressure_divisor = b3^2/4 = 576/4 = 144
    #   GEOMETRIC DERIVATION (Hexagonal Projection)
    #   - Numerically equals chi_eff_total but derived from b3 geometry
    #   - Used in H0 O'Dowd formula: H0 = 288/4 - P_O/pressure_divisor + eta_S
    #   - Represents cross-shadow/global bulk pressure correction
    #
    # PHYSICS NOTE:
    # The dual chi_eff architecture is physically motivated by distinct localization
    # properties of leptons vs quarks. Neutrino neutrality enables cross-shadow
    # propagation; quark confinement restricts them to single-shadow physics.

        # chi_eff_sector = 72 (per-sector effective Euler characteristic)
        # chi_eff_total = 144 = 2 * chi_eff_sector (full manifold)

        # - Formula B: n_gen = chi_eff_total/48 = 144/48 = 3 (total manifold)
        #
        # TWO-SECTOR INTERPRETATION:
        # The G2 manifold has two distinct sectors contributing to fermion generations:
        # 1. Gnostic partition: shadow_sector (135) + christ_constant (153) = 288
        # 2. Physics partition: visible_sector (125) + sterile_sector (163) = 288

        #
        # Reference: Acharya-Witten 2001 (arXiv:hep-th/0109152)

        # This demonstrates that 288 is a sum, not an assumption
        #
        # DUAL INTERPRETATION OF 288:
        # 1. GNOSTIC: 288 = shadow_sector(135) + christ_constant(153)

        #    - Octonionic/24D structure (b3=24 times spinor rank 12)
        #
        # Both interpretations yield the same value. The Gnostic partition

        not a proven geometric derivation.
        Future work: Derive φ from G2 moduli space or calibration conditions.

        DETAILED JUSTIFICATION FOR PHI ANSATZ:
        ----------------------------------------

        1. MATHEMATICAL MOTIVATION:
           φ appears naturally in octonionic multiplication table angles.
           The Fano plane structure encoding octonion multiplication has
           φ-related angular relationships between its 7 imaginary units.

        2. G2 CONNECTION:
           G2 = Aut(O), where O denotes the octonions. Since G2 is the
           automorphism group of the octonions, any geometric structure
           built on G2 holonomy inherits octonionic properties. The
           emergence of φ from this structure is therefore natural, not
           arbitrary.

        3. FIBONACCI SCALING:
           Mass hierarchies in particle physics often follow power-law
           scaling. φ^n provides a natural geometric sequence because:
           - φ satisfies φ^2 = φ + 1 (self-similar recursion)
           - Fibonacci numbers F_n / F_{n-1} → φ asymptotically
           - This recursion mirrors generation structure in fermions

        4. WHAT WAS CONSIDERED AND REJECTED:
           - Arbitrary power laws (2^n, 3^n): These give poor fits to
             observed fermion mass ratios across generations.
           - Random scaling constants: No theoretical motivation.
           - e-based exponentials: φ gives better phenomenological fits
             to the observed electron/muon/tau mass hierarchy.

        5. WHAT WOULD FALSIFY THIS ANSATZ:
           - If a different scaling (e.g., Cabibbo-like sin(θ_C)^n)
             provides demonstrably better fits to mass hierarchies.
           - If future experiments reveal mass ratios inconsistent
             with φ^n scaling patterns.
           - If a rigorous G2 derivation yields a different constant.
